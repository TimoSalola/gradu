abstract = {The flower or seed pattern in a sunflower head can be approximately constructed by the method of Davis and Mathai [1], which has inspired the cover of this journal. This construction reflects, besides the well-known spiral arcs, two kinds of irregularities, one of which is also observed in natural heads, the other not. The latter kind of irregularities is shown to be due to the semiempirical construction employed and can be avoided by a more pertinent, wholly mathematical construction program, which predicts the whole pattern, including the irregularities that are seen in nature, and only these. In particular, concise formulae are given for the points where visible arcs of different order begin and end, and for the concomitant locations of irregularity shaped junction seeds.}

author = {Richard Perez and Pierre Ineichen and Robert Seals and Joseph Michalsky and Ronald Stewart},
abstract = {This paper presents the latest versions of several models developed by the authors to predict short time-step solar energy and daylight availability quantities needed by energy system modelers or building designers. The modeled quantities are global, direct and diffuse daylight illuminance, diffuse irradiance and illuminance impinging on tilted surfaces of arbitrary orientation, sky zenith luminance and sky luminance angular distribution. All models are original except for the last one which is extrapolated from current standards. All models share a common operating structure and a common set of input data: Hourly (or higher frequency) direct (or diffuse) and global irradiance plus surface dew point temperature. Key experimental observations leading to model development are briefly reviewed. Comprehensive validation results are presented. Model accuracy, assessed in terms of root-mean-square and mean bias errors, is analyzed both as a function of insolation conditions and site climatic environment.}

keywords = {PV module performance, Annual energy yield, Crystalline silicon, Copper indium diselenide, Cadmium telluride},
abstract = {A method is presented for estimating the energy yield of photovoltaic (PV) modules at arbitrary locations in a large geographical area. The method applies a mathematical model for the energy performance of PV modules as a function of in-plane irradiance and module temperature and combines this with solar irradiation estimates from satellite data and ambient temperature values from ground station measurements. The method is applied to three different PV technologies: crystalline silicon, CuInSe2 and CdTe based thin-film technology in order to map their performance in fixed installations across most of Europe and to identify and quantify regional performance factors. It is found that there is a clear technology dependence of the geographical variation in PV performance. It is also shown that using long-term average values of irradiance and temperature leads to a systematic positive bias in the results of up to 3%. It is suggested to use joint probability density functions of temperature and irradiance to overcome this bias.}
