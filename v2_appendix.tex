\appendix
\section{Source code}
In total, the project source consists of ~3000 lines of source code divided into multiple files and directories for easier usage. Including the full source in the appendix would not be feasible but the source is available online at github\cite{project_source}. These project files can be downloaded and tested in python environments which meet the recommended python and python package versions detailed in the included Readme.md -file. This same file also includes further description on project structure and usage.


\section{Data files}
The solar PV datasets used in this thesis are private but available upon request. PV datasets are planned to be released along with a data paper at a later point.

The program expects FMI Helsinki and Kuopio csv -files to have names "fmi-helsinki-2021.csv" and "fmi-kuopio-2021.csv" respectively. The exact filenames are not important and files can either be renamed to match these patterns or the data loading code in "solar\_power\_data\_loader2.py" can be modified to match the used .csv files.

Datasets from other sources can also be used but their usage will require some modifications to the program code. If the temporal resolution or csv structure are different from the structure detailed in table\ref{table_fmi_kumpula_csv}, these modifications may be significant.
