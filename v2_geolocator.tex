In order to evaluate the performance of longitude and latitude estimation functions, it may prove useful to be able to translate the error values from degrees to kilometers. The following Equations \ref{equation_latitude_delta_km} and \ref{equation_longitude_delta_km} can be used to approximate the deltas of longitude and latitude estimation functions in kilometers. Note that these functions are only approximations as they rely on the assumption that the Earth is a perfect sphere and not an irregular ellipsoid.

\section{Estimating geographic longitude}
\noindent As mentioned in Sections \ref{section_different_latitudes} and \ref{section_different_longitudes}, the geographic location of a PV system has a strong correlation to the timing of the first and last non-zero measurements of each day whereas the influence of tilt and facing parameters appears to be nonexistent. The relationship would seem to be so clear that without further analysis it would be tempting to use fairly simplistic mathematical models for these estimations. The following longitude estimation Function \ref{equation_naive_longitude} can be derived with two assumptions. These assumptions are that solar noon occurs at 12:00 or 720 minutes at longitude 0$^\circ$ each day and at 6:00 or 360 minutes at 90$^\circ$. Rest of the values can then be linearly interpolated. Note that here solar noon refers to the midpoint between the first and last non-zero minute which is different from astronomical solar noon which occurs nearly at the same time.

As only the first and last non-zero minute times are relevant for longitude and latitude estimation, PVlib POA model is used for both longitude and latitude estimation.

\hfill \break


%The simpler of these relationships is the relationship between the longitude and first and last non-zero minute times. Based on the figure \ref{fig-poa_var_lon2}, this relationship seems to be very close to linear. This makes the use of a simple linear equation rather compelling. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% START

\noindent\textbf{Naive solar noon to longitude equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{equation_naive_longitude}
Longitude(sn)=180^\circ-\frac{360^\circ}{1440}*sn
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where $sn$ is the approximated solar noon minute calculated by taking the average of first and last non-zero power generation minute of a day. % $0.25$ or $360/1440$ corresponds to the longitude degrees per minute and $180$ is used as offset value. This naive equation assumes that solar noon occurs at 12:00 or 720 minutes each day at $0^\circ$ longitude. Note that here solar noon refers to the midpoint between the first and last non-zero minute which is different from astronomical solar noon which occurs nearly at the same time.

\hfill \break
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% END


\noindent The simplicity of Equation \ref{equation_naive_longitude} makes the equation appealing, but the assumption of solar noon occuring at 720 minutes should still be verified. In Figure \ref{fig_solarnoons} solar noons can be seen to occur at around 720 minutes at longitude 0$^\circ$ but they can also be observed occuring 15 minutes earlier or later than that. The cause for this pattern is a combination of Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit \cite{eot}. This 15 minute delta would translate into an error range of $(\pm 15/1440)*360^\circ = \pm 3.75^\circ$ degrees or approximately $\pm 200 km$ at the latitudes of Helsinki according to the Equation \ref{equation_latitude_delta_km}.


Knowing that the PV installation is within a 400 kilometer wide slice may in some cases be enough for determining the country in which the PV installation is located in, but for most other purposes this level of accuracy is unlikely to be valuable. Fortunately the naive model can be improved upon by taking the solar noon timing variation into account.

%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{equation_longitude_estimation_2}
Longitude(sn)= \frac{360}{1440}(sn_{poa}-sn)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $sn$ is the solar noon estimate based on measurement data and $sn_{poa}$ is the simulated solar noon at $0^\circ$ longitude. The new function parameter $sn_{poa}$ compensates for the variation seen in Figure \ref{fig_solarnoons}.

\noindent
%The improved function \ref{equation_longitude_estimation_2} should be much more accurate than the earlier longitude function. as the errors in estimates should primarily be the result of bias in the measurements data.


%In figure \ref{fig_solarnoons_poa_vs_measurement} the solar noon estimates calculated by taking the average of first and last non-zero minute of the day can be seen to preceed the solar noons by roughly 8 minutes. This systematic bias could be explained by the east facing orientation of the panels and correcting for the bias could could be fairly difficult. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
%The theoretical accuracy at this stage could be as high as $\frac{360^\circ}{1440} = 0.25^\circ$ but 
\noindent The improved algorithm should no longer have a systematic error of up to 15 minutes after the difference between solar time and UTC time variation has been taken into account. In addition to correcting for the irregular solar noon timing, the algorithm can be improved even further by using it on larger sections of data and averaging the results, or alternatively, the algorithm could be applied only on selected cloud-free days where the expected errors are likely to be smaller.

If the unfiltered multi-day approach is used, choosing the right day range is crucial. If the range is too narrow, a single outlier value can distort the results significantly, however if the whole year is used, certain periods of the year may contain more noise than others and thus their use could decrease the accuracy of the results. The two scatterplots in Figure \ref{fig_first_last_kuopio_helsinki} show that the data quality from the very first and last days of the year seem to be significantly worse than the data from the longest days of the year. Based on these visualizations, days inside the range 100th to 280th would seem best suited for first and last minute sensitive analysis algorithms for both Helsinki and Kuopio installations.

Based on these visualizations, days outside the range of 100th to 280th would seem unsuitable for first and last minute based analysis between latitudes $60^\circ N$ and $63^\circ N$.

\subsection{Longitude estimation results}
The longitude estimation algorithm was tested on a day range of 125th to 250th for each year in the FMI Helsinki dataset and the results are seen in figure \ref{fig_longitude_estimation_helsinki}. By taking the mean of the longitude predictions for each year in the dataset, the resulting longitude estimates varied between -0.804$^\circ$ to 0.0766$^\circ$ from known installation longitudes. Results for the Kuopio dataset shown in figure \ref{fig_longitude_estimation_kuopio} were similar with mean delta range of -0.1042$^\circ$ to 0.9424$^\circ$.


In kilometers the year with the highest mean deviation of -0.804$^\circ$ in the Helsinki dataset corresponds to an error of approximately 45 kilometers as per \ref{equation_longitude_delta_km}. With Kuopio results the highest delta of 0.9424$^\circ$ is 49 kilometers respectively.

\end{figure}


%The improved algorihm was tested on the day range of 125th to 250th of each year from both FMI datasets and the results can be seen on the Table \ref{table_geolocator_results}. For the Helsinki installations these estimates are all off by less than $0.3^\circ$ while as the Kuopio installation deltas are a bit higher with max of just over $1^\circ$. More impressively, the mean delta of multiple years for the Helsinki dataset is just $0.07^\circ$ and $0.46^\circ$ for Kuopio. In kilometers, the mean deltas can be approximated to 4 and 28 kilometers respectively. The lower accuracy of the Kuopio estimations could be due to multitude of factors ranging from differences in local climate or lower elevation of the installation among others. 




\newpage
\subsection{Possible issues and further development ideas}
PV output measuring systems may not be able to accurately measure when the power output is zero. The capacitance of electrical circuits, instrument accuracy, or other phenomena could lead to small positive or negative power readings even when the PV system is not producing any electricity. Small negative power output readings occur in the FMI datasets and the first and last non-zero power minutes are used instead of first and last greater than zero power minutes, this results in a bias of -3$^\circ$ in the longitude predictions. If similar positive false readings are present in datasets, this could complicate the estimation of the times when power production begins or stops.


While experimenting with the solar minute estimation functions, a curious trait was found. In Figure \ref{fig_solarnoontimes}, the average of the first and last minute is approximately the same for each day at different latitudes as long as the latitude is below 50$^\circ$. As the latitude is increased, the solar noon estimates begin to deviate significantly, becoming strongly skewed after 70$^\circ$. 

At first this behavior seems strange as astronomical solar noon should occur at the same time when longitude and the day are the same regardless of latitude. However as the solar noon estimates are calculated based on the first and last non-zero irradiance minute of the day, it would make sense that the estimations could be off by significant amount during equinoxes due to rapid changes in day lengths. Thus the day range was split into two sections and the color of days was chosen according to their distance from equinoxes. Line color was chosen based on distance from equinoxes where darker lines were the furthest away. This structure visible in the figure suggest that day length variation is a likely to be a factor in the phenomena. 


In theory, if the same bias occurs in both the measurements and the modeled first and last positive power minutes, no corrections would be needed. The effect should be also lessened by using longer day ranges for predicting longitudes or by making sure that the intervals include an equal amount of days from both halves of the year as the direction in which this error occurs appears to be the opposite on both halves of the year.

Improvements in the algorithm accuracy could be achieved via by increasing the sampling interval of the irradiance simulations. PVlib POA simulations include a parameter for sampling frequency which is currently set to 1-per-minute in order to match the measuring frequency of FMI datasets. This could be increased to 1-per-second and the added resolution could help in determining more accurate estimates for solar noon times, resulting in possible gains in algorithm accuracy.

PVlib POA model was used instead of the more complex reflection and temperature aware model. This could be done as the geolocation is connected to first and last non-zero minute times which should be the same for both models. However even the POA model might be overly complicated as only two time values are needed. The usage of a much simpler model could increase computational speed significantly.

\section{Estimating geographic latitude}
Similarly to the longitude, the latitude of an installation is strongly connected to the timing of the first and last non-zero minutes of the day. This means that PVlib POA simulations can be used instead of the more complex PV model.

In earlier Figure \ref{fig_poa_var_lat}, the simulated first and last minutes can be seen to change day by day at varying rates based on the latitude. In mathematical terms it could be said that the slope of the day-to-first-minute function is determined by the latitude of the installation. And for the days around equinoxes, and at higher latitudes of $50^\circ$ to $70^\circ$, this relationship would seem to be bijective as per earlier Figure \ref{fig_poa_var_lat}. The following algorithm is based on the former observations.


\hfill


\subsection{Latitude algorithm}
%\noindent\textbf{Latitude algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Simulate first non-zero minutes for a day range A to B at a given latitude.
  
  \item Fit a line to the simulated day to first minute pairs from step 1. Save the line slopes and the corresponding latitude.
  
  \item Repeat steps 1 and 2 for multiple latitudes.
  
  \item Create a slope to latitude graph from the earlier steps.
  
  \item Fit an n-degree polynomial equation to the graph from step 4.
  
  \item Select the day range A to B from a solar PV dataset and fit a line to the first non-zero power minutes. Feed the slope of this line to the polynomial from step 5. Value of this polynomial is an approximation of the latitude of the PV system.
  
 
  
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Notes:}
%A visualization of the algorithm can be seen in the following figure \ref{fig_slope_to_latitude}. 
Due to seasonal differences in data quality, polar winters and the midnight sun, the range of days chosen for the algorithm is important. If the range is short, individual outliers in measurements can result in large errors. Whereas if the range is too long, it will be harder to choose the range while avoiding low data quality sections. In the algorithm visualization Figure \ref{fig_slope_to_latitude}, the range of 250th to 300th seems to result in a good linear fit.

\subsection{Improving latitude prediction algorithm}
The results of the algorithm shown in Table \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results} are somewhere in the correct region, but the delta of over $4^\circ$ in the 2020 estimate is significant and much higher than the error of the longitude estimation algorithm. The first step in improving the algorithm would be the use of last non-zero minutes as well as the first non-zero minutes. This doubles the amount of outputs from the algorithm and while doubling the amount of outputs does not directly increase the accuracy of the algorithm, it can provide additional insights into the performance of the algorithm. %This is especially valuable as the available datasets are small.

%Figure \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_f_and_l} shows that predictions based on first and last minutes contain similar errors. This is to be expected and it shows that both first and last minutes of each day have similar potetial for latitude estimation. 


\noindent The second step in improving the algorithm is choosing the best possible day range for latitude estimation. One way of choosing the day ranges would be by testing multiple day ranges and choosing the range which results in the lowest average absolute error from the known latitude, but this is problematic as the correct latitude should not be assumed to be known. However if there were multiple datasets with complete metadata, this could be used in order to find universally well-behaving day ranges.

\textit{Standard deviation minimization} is another option for day range selection. As there are two estimated latitude values per year, datasets with $n$ years of data would provide $n*2$ estimated latitude values. Standard deviation of these values could expected to be small if the day interval does not contain days with bad data quality and this means that the interval selection can be automated. Following Figure \ref{fig_heatmap3d2} shows a heatmap for FMI Helsinki latitude estimation. Lowest found standard deviation occured with the day interval 180th to 310th with standard deviation of 0.3788$^\circ$.


%However exhaustively searching the day interval space with reasonable intervals can be slow and as seen in the figure \ref{fig_heatmap3d2}, low standard deviation intervals are common in the parameter space. As a result, an arbitrarily chosen long interval is likely to perform almost as well as the very best algoritmicly chosen interval.

%This same figure indicates that an arbitrarily chosen long interval is likely to perform almost as well as the very best algoritmicly chosen interval.


%If the day range is selected well, these estimations could be expected to be tightly grouped. This tight grouping can be measured by calculating the standard deviation and thus the day interval with the lowest standard deviation could be expected to result in the best latitude estimation. A such method relies on the assumption that low standard deviation correlates with good preditions, but this assumption can be shown to be false or missleading. The following figure \ref{fig_heatmap3d2} shows that

\subsection{Latitude estimation results}
Latitude estimation appears to be more challenging to optimize than longitude estimation. With the Helsinki dataset the found low standard deviation interval 180-310 predictions shown in Table \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_180_310} do not seem to be better than those achieved by an arbitrarily chosen interval 190-250 shown in Table \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_190_250}. This observation is supported by the flatness of the standard deviation space in Figure \ref{fig_heatmap3d2} which also suggest that large sections in the day interval space have a similarly low standard deviation. Results for the Kuopio installation have higher variance but the scatter appears to otherwise be similar as seen on Table \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_kuopio}.

%Achieved results are fairly good and they will be left as is.


%Results for the Kuopio dataset contain similar variance with the interval 190-280 resulting in predictions shown in Table \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_kuopio}.

\subsection{Possible issues and further development ideas}
PVlib POA based first and last minute estimations are slower to compute than necessary as only two timestamps are needed. The use of a simpler sunrise and sunset equation would increase the speed significantly, allowing for the use of brute force day range selection algorithms.

Different methods could also be used. In Hagdadi 2017 \cite{navid_australian_article} latitude estimations are done by fitting solar irradiance models with 3 unknown parameters to power generation measurement data. The latitude deltas of 1.65$^\circ$ to 3.42$^\circ$ in the 2017 article are higher than those achieved in this thesis, however as the datasets, geographical regions and algorithms are different, direct comparison can not be made.

%by this paper, however as the datasets, geographical regions and algorithms are different, direct comparison can not be made.

In earlier Figure \ref{fig_slope_to_latitude} the slope to latitude fitting is not perfect. The use of higher degree polynomials may result in a closer fit which in turn may result in a marginal improvement in latitude prediction accuracy. Alternatively a piecewise linear interpolation based fitting could be used. Both methods can in theory result in higher estimation accuracy at the risk of overfitting.
 

The two day intervals 180 to 310 and 190 to 250 may be biased. For the interval 180 to 310 all of the intervals result in positive error values whereas with 190 to 250 these errors mostly negative. This suggests that there could be biases in the data which do not influence standard deviation of the results. This will be left as a possible topic of study for future studies.

\section{Combined latitude and longitude estimations}
As it is unlikely that the longitude and latitude estimation algorithms are used in isolation from one another, their results should be examined together. This can be done by plotting the estimated locations on a map. Here the two installations in Helsinki and Kuopio and their predicted locations per year are plotted side by side. Plotted latitudes are from earlier tables \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_190_250}, \ref{table_geolocator_latitude_results_kuopio} and longitudes are from the longitude prediction algorithm using an arbitrarily chosen day range of 190th to 280th.

\noindent In the Helsinki predictions figure, the estimated geolocations are scattered around the known installation location, showing very little bias and some random noise. Similar behavior can be seen in Kuopio predictions where two outliers 2017 and 2020 deviate more significatly. One degree on the latidue axis is approximately 110 km regardless of latitude and longitude, one degree of longitude is 56km at $60^\circ$ N and 50 km at $63^\circ$ N. As the variance is strongest on the latitude axis, it is likely that the latitude prediction algorithm is more sensitive to variations in the data and further development should be focused on more accurate latitude prediction and day range selection.


The results can be compared to the data resolution. One minute delta in measurements corresponds to a longtudinal shift of 14 kilometers in longitudinal axis at $60^\circ$. As the point cloud width is approximately $1^\circ$ or 50km, the estimates can be thought to have a longitudinal range of 50km, $1^\circ$ or 3.5 minutes with nearly the same values for the Kuopio installation. As the temporal resolution of measurements is 1 minute, the algorithm should not be limited by temporal resolution.
